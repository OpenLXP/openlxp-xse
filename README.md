# OpenLXP - Experience Search Engine (XSE)

This directory contains the code to install, configure, and run a search engine to support the OpenLXP platform.

## Intended use

Intended use of this code is that a user could reference this code and architecture as boilerplate code to stand-up a search engine for their learning experience platform on OpenLXP.

## Capabilities and limitations

The code within this repository is specifically for [Elasticsearch 7.11](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.11/getting-started.html) as the search engine. We are utilizing Elasticsearch for representative purposes, users can leverage an additional search engine as it fits their budget and architecture.

## Directions for use

TO-DO: Build out docker compose / cluster configuration to bootstrap the installation and configuration of the cluster.
